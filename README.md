* Even though December's temperature is lower, its temperature is still considered "hot" as its mean is 71F.
* December's temperature varies more than June's. December (December's standard deviation is 3.74 and June's standard deviation is 3.25)

## Summary
* In general, it is safe to say that Hawaii has hot weather through out the year 
* However the temperature has got as low as 60F sometime in January in the past years.
* Alternative food options during colder season may add revenue to the ice cream shop.
